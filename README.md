## Config Server
A Config Server is responsible for managing and serving the configuration of different microservices in a centralized manner. 
This ensures that all services have consistent and up-to-date configurations without needing to be redeployed for configuration changes.

## Discovery Server
A Discovery Server, also known as a Service Registry, is responsible for maintaining a registry of microservices. 
It allows microservices to discover and communicate with each other without hardcoding the network locations (IP addresses/ports).
